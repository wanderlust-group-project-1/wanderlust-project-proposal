\section{Project Goal and Objectives}
\subsection{Goal}
Our main goal is to introduce a fully functional web-based system for campers and hikers around the island to prepare for their journey through one platform. Though Wanderlust will be an initiative in Sri Lanka, weâ€™ve had positive responses from the public through the survey we conducted, and they encouraged us to go forward with this project. This system can facilitate pre-booking and renting of camping equipment and hiring reliable guides for traveling enthusiasts. Moreover, this platform will provide an excellent opportunity for guides and rental ships to make a solid customer base and flourish their respective businesses.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Camping Equipment Rental Service: Providing an efficient system for rental services to list their camping equipment inventory.
